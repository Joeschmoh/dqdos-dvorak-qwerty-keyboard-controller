# Introduction #

This program does several things --
  * Allows quick and easy switching between Dvorak and Qwerty layouts.
  * Provides keyboard filtering to deliver a "Dvorak-Qwerty" layout. This provides Dvorak keys normally, but Qwerty keys when used with keys like Control, Alt, and Windows.
  * Turns scroll-lock into a layout switcher.
  * Allows users to set their own "Primary" and "Secondary" layouts. So in theory this can switch between any two keyboard layouts.

I have admittedly mostly tested using Dvorak and Qwerty, and simple tests with other layouts.
